"Implement an autocomplete system. That is, given a query string s and a set of all possible query strings, return all strings in the set that have s as a prefix."
"For example, given the query string de and the set of strings [dog, deer, deal], return [deer, deal]."
"Hint: Try preprocessing the dictionary into a more efficient data structure to speed up queries."

            y.remove(y[i])
